**Overview:**

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the functionality of pyhton's streamlit library which is a powerful library for dashboard creation.

**Install:**

pip install streamlit

**Fetching data:**

For the "Streamlit_sales_data.py" file, the sales data was downloaded from https://www.pk-anexcelexpert.com/design-publish-and-share-a-sales-dashboard-in-power-bi/
There is an initial dashboard created with Power BI in thiss video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6NQvaDW6q0) and I have tried to regenrate similar dashboard using the open source python library Streamlit.

**Using Streamlit:**

Once the streamlit is installed, I opened the Pycharm IDE and created new file names "Streamlit_sales_data". To run this file, I went to the terminal and then to the file directory using cd command. Then the following command is executed to run the file in the browser.

streamlit run streamlit_sales_data.py

This is show the dashboard created using the streamlit in the browser.


**Conclusion:**

The code editting can be done by spliting the display into half, half showing the code and the other half showing the output in the browser. This process can speed up the debugging procedure of the code.
